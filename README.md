```

This will:
- Install Go (if needed, macOS/Homebrew only)

#### Manual Install

1. **Clone or Download** this repository.
2. **Add the wand tool to your PATH** (if not already):
   ```zsh
   export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/wand"
   ```
   (Replace `/path/to/wand` with the actual directory.)
3. **(Optional) Add to your zshrc** for convenience:
   ```zsh
   echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/wand"' >> ~/.zshrc
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

## Configuration

Edit the `example.json` file to define your environments and hosts. Example:

```json
[
  {
    "servers": [
      {
        "connection": "rdp",
        "name": "winmachine001",
        "user": "jabbo",
        "host": "12.345.678.90"
      },
      {
        "connection": "ssh",
        "name": "linuxjump001",
        "host": "12.345.678.90",
        "user": "jabbo",
        "identityFile": ["~/.ssh/id_rsa"]
      },
      {
        "name": "secretvpn001",
        "uses_jumpHost": true,
        "host": "12.345.678.90",
        "jumpHost": ["linuxjump001"]
      }
    ]
